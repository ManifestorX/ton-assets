  The Bitza meme token was created in honor of the renowned programmer Laszlo Hanyecz, who made history by purchasing two pizzas for 10,000 BTC — the first real-world transaction ever conducted with Bitcoin. This iconic event marked the beginning of cryptocurrency’s use as a medium of exchange and is now celebrated every year on May 22nd as Bitcoin Pizza Day.
